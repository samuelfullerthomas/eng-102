Engineering 102


The purpose of this repo is to have a good resource for learning for U.S. CSEs

## Getting Started
First, you'll want a copy of Sublime Text 3 (or your favorite text editor) and the Standard and ES6 linter packages installed. To install packages into Sublime, you'll want to have have installed [package.io](http://package.io/)

Other fun additions: JS Gutter is a good one, as it helps show you the changes that you've made to your file

## The repo
The repo is a skeleton structure for a React app, written in ES6 and JSX, running a node/express server. It uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a module packager. Read more about them both here at their respective websites.

## Up an running
So, this project uses a makefile to run it's tasks. Makefiles let you create a file that runs commands in the commandline in a local repository. So kind of like Grunt. But much older.

After running an npm install, you're almost there. You'll want to run make watch and and then make start, and then you can naviagte to localhost:3000/index.html and you'll see a friendly message!

## Learning to do
The first thing that you should get up to speed on is ES6. I found that this tutorial was probably the most helpful : http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial/

Next, this react tutorial from the react devs is a great place to start

Finally, if you're wanting to get back up to speed on node and express (and maybe connecting that with a database), this is the tutorial for you : http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/
